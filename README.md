# Source Cooperative Viewers

The Source Cooperative Viewers is a webapp with interactive data viewers for data served through HTTP.
These viewers power the dataset browser on Source Cooperative but can operate independently from Source Cooperative.

## Project Goals

The goal for this project is to enable large datasets to be explored through a browser.
By focusing on supporting cloud-native data formats we can enable the exploration of these datasets without having to download the entire dataset.

## Demo

Viewers can be explored and interacted with at [https://viewers.source.coop](https://viewers.source.coop).
These viewers currently support any file served through HTTP.

## Current Viewers

- Markdown (md)
- Text File (txt, csv, tsv, md)
- Map (GeoJSON, PMTiles)
- Table (csv, tsv)

## Creating or Improving a Viewer

The viewer components are developed at https://github.com/source-cooperative/components. For more information on how to contribute to this project, see the [contribution guide](https://github.com/source-cooperative/components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
